## Description

</span>

AVID is a python framework for the **data-driven processing** of huge amounts of data.

It provides a series of actions that can be used to process the data, including `resampling`, `registration`, `radiomics feature calculation` or `python-based actions`. These 
are just examples, a more detailed list can be found [below](#available-actions). 

AVID enables to select, link, sort, and split the data by user defined criteria, e.g. `case_id` and `timepoint`.


## Example

A detailed description of AVID basic concepts and example on how to use it can be found under avid\examples\AVID_introduction.ipynb.

## Quick start

### Installation

#### Python requirements
You must use python 3.x

Add your python directory and python/scripts to your Windows PATH as otherwise, neither python, nor avidconfig will be found!

#### Option 1: Install via pip
The simplest way to install AVID is via PyPi. Simply use the following command to install AVID and all its dependencies:

</span>

```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ avid2
```

#### Option 2: Install via the repository

A detailed description on how to install AVID from the repository, can be found [here](manual_installation.md).


### Configuration

AVID itself is a python framework for data-driven processing. It provides a variety of actions to do so. Many of these actions use external tools, like [MITK Mini Apps]( https://docs.mitk.org/nightly/AdvancedTopicsPage.html#MiniAppExplainPage), which need to be 
configured in order for avid to find and access them.

#### Configure your AVID tools path
To configure AVID to find the needed tools, use
```
avidconfig settings avid.toolspath <your_desired_tools_path>
```
Please have in mind that python/scripts has to be in PATH!

## Get the tools (for the AVID actions)

<span style="color:grey">
REMARK: This tools feature is currently only supported for Windows systems.
For Linux and MacOS you have to build the tools directly on your machine.
You have two choices:
1. "install" the tools. This means that you will get copies to the tools, but
   it is not connected to any versioning of the version control system the tools
   are stored in.
2. "update" the tools. This will make an svn checkout/update on the central tool
   repository. This is interesting for developers or if you will often update the avid source
   and you want to have an easy possibility to update the tools accordingly.
3. "add" the tools. This will allow to register tools "by hand". This is interesting for
   tools that are currently not centrally stored or are local developments.

###install all tools specified by your AVID distribution
requirement is an installed SVN (accessible via commandline, e.g. https://tortoisesvn.net.
Be sure to enable command line support in installation) and Visual Studio 2013
redistributable installer for x64 (https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/download/details.aspx?id=40784)

use
```
  avidconfig tools install
```

###update all tools specified by your AVID distribution
use
```
  avidconfig tools update
```

###install or update specific tools
use
```
  avidconfig tools install <toolname1> [<toolname2> [...]]
```
or
```
  avidconfig tools update <toolname1> [<toolname2> [...]]
```

###add own/specific tools
use
```
  avidconfig tools add <toolname/actionID> <path to executable>
```
This will registere a new tool with the given toolname/actionID and let the configuration point to the also specified
executable.

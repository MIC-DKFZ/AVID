## Development Workflow
### Development
1. Creat your feature branch
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/short-description
  ```
2. Make your code changes

Develop your idea or your bug fix in you're venv/repo clone.
If everything is ready, look for the next section to prepare your contribution for a pull request.
If you have ideas to improve, fix or somehow advance AVID, **please feel whole heartily invited and encouraged to
discuss the issues and ideas beforehand** over the GitHub issue section: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/AVID/issues  

### Pull request preparation
1. Format & lint your code before committing:

  ```bash
  black .
  isort .
  ```

2. Run tests:

  ```bash
  python -m unittest
  ```
Ensure that all tests are green. You may ignore skipped tests due to not available CLI tools as long as you change
does not impact those tools.

### Making a pull request (on GitHub)

1. Push your branch to your fork:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/short-description
  ```
2. Go to your fork on GitHub and click Compare & pull request.
3. Include the following information:
   - A short, descriptive title
   - What changes you made 
   - Why these changes are necessary 
   - Any relevant issue numbers (e.g., Closes #42)
4. Ensure your branch passes CI checks:
   - All tests pass 
   - Black formatting applied

5. Request a review from maintainers if necessary. 
6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.
7. After merge, delete your feature branch locally and on your GitHub fork.
